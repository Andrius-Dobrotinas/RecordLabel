# RecordLabel
ASP.NET MVC application designed for presentation and management of a record label's release catalogue, news and articles

It was commissioned by a specific client but then cancelled halfway through when they realized they did not have the required infrastructure to host an ASP.NET-based application. I decided to keep working on this project out of personal interest.
Currently, it features the original client-commissioned visual design and structure, but I am going to modify and imporove that in the course of further development.
Used technologies:
• Written in C#
• JavaScript/jQuery using the object-oriented approach
• EntityFramework (code-first approach)
• Bootstrap framework for UX

Some interesting features:
• Allows for entering content in different languages
• Dynamic loading of items in a list
• Logged-in users see "Edit" buttons to editable content in the same publicly accessible pages.
