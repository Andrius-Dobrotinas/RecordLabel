# RecordLabel
ASP.NET MVC application designed for presentation and management of a record label's release catalogue, news and articles in multiple languages.

It was commissioned by a specific client but then cancelled halfway through because they did not have the required infrastructure to host an ASP.NET-based application. I keept working on this project out of personal interest but soon I decided to shut it down and start a new version because this project was plagued by bad design which was a result of constantly changing requirements, focus on the wrong things, experimentations and corner-cutting. Anyway, it was a good exercise and I've learned from my mistakes.
This branch is in the state of restructurization where I attempted at dividing the back end into separate layers (this is why I started https://github.com/Andrius-Dobrotinas/EntityPlus project), and therefore the application is in the broken state.

Used technologies:
• Written in C#
• JavaScript/jQuery using the object-oriented approach
• Entity Framework (code-first approach)
• Bootstrap framework for UX
